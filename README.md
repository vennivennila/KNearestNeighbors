## 📖 Overview

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful algorithm that:
- Stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on similarity.
- Works for both classification and regression problems.
- Does **not** require training (lazy learner).

This notebook demonstrates:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model creation using `KNeighborsClassifier`
- Training and prediction
- Evaluation using accuracy metrics
- Visualization (if applicable)
- Parameter tuning (`k` selection)

## 🤖 What is KNN?

KNN works by:
1. Finding the `k` data points in the training set that are closest to the new data point.
2. Assigning the most common label among those neighbors to the new point.

✅ **Advantages:**
- Simple to implement
- No training step
- Good accuracy for smaller datasets

⚠️ **Disadvantages:**
- Slow for large datasets
- Sensitive to irrelevant features and data scaling
